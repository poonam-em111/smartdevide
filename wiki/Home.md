# Welcome to the SmartDevIDE Wiki

SmartDevIDE is an **enterprise-grade AI coding assistant** with role-based behavior, multi-model support, and intelligent prompt enhancement for **VS Code** and **Cursor**.

---

## What is SmartDevIDE?

SmartDevIDE extends your editor with:

- **8 developer roles** (Backend, Laravel, React, QA, Tech Lead, etc.) so the AI matches your job
- **Multi-model support** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cursor)
- **Inline AI suggestions** as you type
- **Generate Code**, **Fix with AI**, and **Explain** from the Command Palette or context menu
- **Security Review** – scan code for SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, insecure auth
- **Testing & Validation** – generate unit tests, edge cases, run static checks, flag risky logic
- **Project style auto-learn** – follows ESLint, Prettier, PHP-CS-Fixer and your folder structure so it never fights your style guide
