## Current status (v2.0.x)

- Role-based AI (8 roles)  
- Multi-model (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cursor)  
- Inline completions, Fix with AI, Explain  
- Generate Code with optional testing/validation quick pick  
- Security Review (SQL injection, secrets, auth)  
- Testing & Validation: unit tests, edge cases, static checks, flag risky logic  
- Project style auto-learn (ESLint, Prettier, PHP-CS-Fixer, naming, folder structure)  
- Whole-project context and framework detection  
- VS Code and Cursor support via VSIX

## Planned / ideas

- **Marketplace** – Publish to VS Code Marketplace for one-click install  
- **Ollama / local models** – Use local LLMs without an API key  
- **More providers** – Additional model backends as needed  
- **Test runner integration** – Run generated tests from the editor  
- **Configurable “offer testing after Generate Code”** – Toggle the quick pick in settings
